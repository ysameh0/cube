Cube Cloud supports authenticating users through Okta, which is useful when you
want your users to access Cube Cloud using single sign on. This guide will walk
you through the steps of configuring SAML authentication in Cube Cloud with
Okta. You **must** be an account administrator in your Okta organization to
access the Admin Console and create a SAML integration.

## Enable SAML in Cube Cloud

First, we'll enable SAML 2.0 authentication in Cube Cloud. To do this, log in to Cube Cloud
and click your username from the top-right corner, then click <Btn>Team & Security</Btn>
and from the <Btn>Authentication & SSO</Btn> tab, ensure <Btn>SAML 2.0</Btn> is enabled:

Take note of the <Btn>Single Sign On URL</Btn> and <Btn>Audience</Btn> values here, as we will
need them in the next step when we configure the SAML integration in Okta.

## Create a SAML Integration in Okta

1. Log in to your Okta organization as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking <Btn>Admin</Btn> in the top-right corner.
3. Click <Btn>Applications > Applications</Btn> from the navigation on the left of the screen.
4. Click <Btn>Create App Integration</Btn>.
5. Select <Btn>SAML 2.0</Btn> and click <Btn>Next</Btn>.
6. Enter a name for your application and click <Btn>Next</Btn>. You can optionally upload a logo for the application,
   but this is not required.
7. Enter the following values in the <Btn>SAML Settings</Btn> section:
    - **Single sign on URL**: Use the <Btn>Single Sign On URL</Btn> value from Cube Cloud.
    - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: Use the <Btn>Audience</Btn> value from Cube Cloud.
8. Create the following entries in the <Btn>Attribute Statements</Btn> section:

| Name  | Name format | Value            |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| email | Basic       | `user.email`     |
| name  | Basic       | `user.firstName` |

9. Click <Btn>Next</Btn> and then <Btn>Finish</Btn> to complete the integration.
